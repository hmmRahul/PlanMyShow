## **Reflection**

This was a 2 week long project built during the Lockdown Period. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  
I have Learnt Retrofit Library and also how to do API calls which was a new concept for me.I have also learnt how to use ROOM database which is A new component in Android Jetpack.
